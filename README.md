### Locaite.net

Seamlessly share local dev links

See https://locaite.net for example usage.

Locaite.net is a tool designed for web developers to facilitate sharing links to pages on each other's local development environments, even when they use different local domains and ports. This is achieved by replacing the domain name and port of a local address with a custom prefix followed by ".locaite.net". The chosen prefix should be concise and representative of the project name.

When another developer receives such a link and clicks on it, they are redirected to the corresponding page on their own local development site, assuming they have pre-configured Locaite.net appropriately. The configuration process is a one-time setup, and no data is stored by Locaite.net, ensuring privacy and security in the development workflow.

This system streamlines collaboration among developers by providing a consistent method for accessing local resources without the need for manual adjustments to domain names and ports.
